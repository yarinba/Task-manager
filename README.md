# Clinet-side Task Manager App

The tasks which you add and the updates which you make to them are stored in a MongoDB database, <br>
which means that everything you do is saved -  <br>
i.e. changes you make in one session will be visible in the next session. <br><br>

The Node.js backend uses Express.js and routes requests from the client to the database.
